# videogamephysics

I created this website as a final project for SFSU CSC412 in the Spring of 2017. To create this website I used Vue.js and p5.js
to create the simulations, as well as bootstrap for the layout and styling. 

You can view the website host here on [Github Pages](https://ericgroom.github.io/videogamephysics)
